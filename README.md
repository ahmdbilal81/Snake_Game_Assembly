    <h1>Snake Game Clone</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Snake Game Clone project! This is a classical game, and in this project, I have created a clone of the iconic Snake Game.</p>

    <p>This project was developed as the final assessment for the Computer Organization and Assembly Language course at FAST-NU, Lahore, during my third semester of the Data Science degree.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>

    <p>To enjoy the Snake Game Clone, follow these simple steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Download nasm and doxbox</li>
        <li>Place the asm file in the same folder</li>
        <li>Write</li>
        <pre><code>nasm filename.asm -o filename.com</code></pre>
        
        <li>After compilation, write file Name and hit enter</li>
        

        <li>Start playing the Snake Game! Use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or yourself.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, and have fun!</p>
