<h2>Snake Game Clone</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Snake Game Clone project! This is a classical game, and in this project, I have created a clone of the iconic Snake Game.</p>

<p>This project was developed as the final assessment for the Computer Organization and Assembly Language course at FAST-NU, Lahore, during my third semester of the Data Science degree.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>To enjoy the Snake Game Clone, follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download nasm and doxbox</li>
<li>Place the asm file in the same folder</li>
<li>Write</li>
<pre><code>nasm filename.asm -o filename.com</code></pre>
        
<li>After compilation, write file Name and hit enter</li>
        

<li>Start playing the Snake Game! Use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or yourself.</li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, and have fun!</p>
